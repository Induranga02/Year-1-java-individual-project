# Year-1-java-individual-project
This is my first year java individual project.
The provided code is a Java program for a simple theater seat booking system. It allows users to interact with the system through a command-line interface to buy tickets, view the seating area, cancel tickets, list available seats, save seat information to a file, load information from a file, view ticket information, and quit the program. Here's a brief overview of the code's structure and functionality:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes various arrays to represent the seating rows and uses an ArrayList to store ticket information. It also creates a `Person` object and a `Ticket` object as an example.

2. **Main Menu**: The main part of the code is structured around a main menu that users interact with. It displays options and takes user input to perform various actions. The menu includes options to buy tickets, print the seating area, cancel tickets, list available seats, save to a file, load from a file, display ticket information, and sort tickets by price. Users can also quit the program.

3. **Functions**: The code defines functions for each menu option. These functions handle the core functionality of the program, such as buying tickets, displaying the seating area, canceling tickets, showing available seats, saving and loading data, and displaying ticket information.

4. **Data Validation**: The code performs validation on user input to ensure that row and seat numbers are within valid ranges.

5. **File Handling**: It provides functionality to save information about the seating area to a file and load that information from a file.

6. **Ticket Information**: The code keeps track of ticket information, including names, surnames, emails, row and seat numbers, and prices. It calculates and displays the total price of the tickets.

7. **Quitting**: Users can choose to quit the program, which provides a closing message.

Overall, this code represents a basic theater seat booking system that allows users to book, cancel, and view tickets in a command-line interface. It demonstrates concepts such as data structures, user input handling, file I/O, and menu-driven program design.
